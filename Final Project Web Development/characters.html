                A veteran hunter, an old friend of the Winchesters' father and over time evolved into a father-figure
                for his sons Sam and Dean. He is also one of the longest lasting recurring characters, apart from Sam
                and Dean. Bobby equals badass and bobby equals cute, and if someone can be badass savage and cute at the
                same time, just like Dean, what more do you want from a character.

                Castiel is a strong, determined, impulsive, competitive and naïve celestial being. Like most angels,
                Castiel expresses little to no emotion, which creates flaws and complexities in his persona. Castiel was
                absolutely confident in the justice of Heaven. Now he’s not sure anymore, and that makes him
                unpredictable. What is predictable is his lack of normal social skills. He doesn’t respect personal
                space, doesn’t understand jokes, and is confused by Dean’s constant use of colloquial language.

                A Personal Favorite, Crowley is probably the only demon(and Interim Devil) that I want to be friends
                with. Potrayed as a cunning and heartless demon when the character was introduced, Crowley went on to
                become a Lonely, longing for love and friendship, kind of a guy, who was more than what people would
                expect from someone of his designation. He is funny, he is a badass and he can be needy sometimes, but
                never monotonous.

                Jack Kline (b. May 18, 2017) (doesn't look like a 5 year old, does he?) is the son of Lucifer and Kelly
                Kline. He is the first and only known Nephilim to be sired by an Archangel. Jack was taken in by Sam
                Winchester and Dean Winchester who would teach him how to master his powers. During this time, Jack
                played a role in the resurrection of Castiel who he had chosen as his father.
