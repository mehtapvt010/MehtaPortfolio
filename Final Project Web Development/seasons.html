                  The Kripke Era: Could There Be Any Saga That's More Epic?

                  The Kripke era refers to the seasons of Supernatural helmed by its creator, Eric Kripke and
                  co-showrunner Robert Singer. It encompasses Season 1 up to Season 5. The first five seasons contain
                  the exposition of the main characters of the show, and, although contained season-long story arcs,
                  actually built up to a climactic five-season arc about supernatural forces working to usher in the
                  Apocalypse.The events of this era would set up the main conflicts of the Gamble Era, which focuses on
                  monsters and a new supernatural dimension, Purgatory.

                  The Gamble Era covers Season 6 and Season 7, when Sera Gamble took over showrunner duties with Robert
                  Singer following the departure of Eric Kripke. The two seasons introduce loosely-related arcs as
                  opposed to the Kripke Era, but both deal with the power vacuum left by the averted Apocalypse, and the
                  collective rise of monsters to prominence. The former season begins a year from the aftermath of the
                  Apocalypse, but also explains what happened in the interim. It features a three-way power struggle
                  between Heaven, Hell, and a new major supernatural dimension, Purgatory. The latter introduces a
                  drastic change in the balance of power as Castiel declares himself the new God, and with the arrival
                  of new powerful beings referred to as the Old Ones from Purgatory.

                  The Singer and Carver era covers Season 8 to Season 10, when Jeremy Carver and Robert Singer became
                  co-showrunners following the departure of Sera Gamble. In Season 11, Robert Singer stepped down into
                  an Executive Consultant Role leaving Carver as the sole Executive Producer for that year. This era
                  brings the show back to Heaven versus Hell roots in terms of story arc. Also, a key characteristic is
                  that its seasonal arcs are more self-contained as opposed to the previous two eras. Whereas previous
                  eras would transition to the next season as an intended goal or clear continuation of the preceding
                  arc (i.e., all events leading to the Apocalypse, the opening of Purgatory and the use of its souls),
                  this era often leads to the next season with unclear or surprise by-products of the previous conflict.

                  This era introduces a new central character, the nephilim Jack Kline, son of Lucifer. Having the
                  potential to surpass the powers of an archangel, Jack's existence has caught the attention of
                  different organizations, major powers, and, even beings from alternate realities and dimensions. Sam,
                  Dean and Castiel took Jack under their wing, fending off multiple enemies while also ensuring Jack
                  learns to control his powers and use them for good. The interactions between alternate universes
                  eventually culminate into the intervention of cosmic powers Billie as the new Death, the Shadow, the
                  Darkness, and a confrontation with God.

              The Impala, which Dean calls 'Baby' is honestly one of favorite aspects of the show. Its silent, its
              powerful, kills its fair share of Supernatural creatures and as far as being a car is concerned, it is an
              absolute badass. A significant part of the show has actually been shot inside The Impala, and to me, it is
              one of the most important characters of the show and has been a constant right from the beginning.

              One of the coolest things about the show are the Weapons, Tools and Lore. After the boys received updates
              about something supernatural happening around, Sam would research and while it sounds boaring, this is a
              part of the process I really love. The inclusion of spells, magic and elixirs was done a bit later in the
              show, and it was a brilliant move. The good ol' weapons, both modern and vintage, have been there since
              the start and have never failed to add to the overall effect and impact of the show. Some of the most
              popular weapons are listed below and while its not easy to list all on this page, <a
                href="https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Weapon">Supernatural Fandom</a> link a fantastic
              website to checkout the Supernatural Weapons.
