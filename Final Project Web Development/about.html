              Target</h3>
            This page tries to collect interesting facts, news, opinions and information about Supernatural and collects
            and presents it in a single website, which if you ask me, is kind of awesome if you see from the perspective
            of fans and people who want to know more about the show. It has pages for recent news, characters, seasons
            and forums, thus aiming at become a one-stop website for the show enthusiasts, both cureent and potential.
