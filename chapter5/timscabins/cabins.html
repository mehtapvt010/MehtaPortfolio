        <dt>Our Cabins</dt>
         <dd>Our luxury Cabins are permanent structures 2
          feet off the ground. Each cabin has cedar walls,
          a wooden floor, and a skylight that can be
          opened.</dd>
        <dt>How are the cabins furnished?</dt>
          <dd>Each cabin is furnished with a queen-size bed
          with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury
          camping experience also includes electricity and
          a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
          and restroom facilities are located in the
          lodge.</dd>
        <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
          <dd>Bring a bathing suit and some time to relax!
          Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes
          and plan to dress for changing weather with
          layers of clothing.</dd>
